### README Documentation

## Application Overview

The application I have chosen to develop is a Weather Forecast Application that provides users with real-time and forecasted weather data for any location they input. This application serves a practical purpose by allowing users to plan their activities based on weather conditions.

# Functionality

-Users input a city name to retrieve real-time weather data.
-The application displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather description.
-A 5-day weather forecast feature is included.
-Users can filter results by specific weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, temperature range).
-Implement error handling for invalid locations or API failures.
